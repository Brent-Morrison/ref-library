## Models

<br>

| Question | Answer | Reference |  
| :------- | :----- | :-------- |  
| Naive Bayes assumptions      | Independence among predictors - assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature. |  |  
| Which modeling techniques require predictors to have a common scale? | 1. Neural networks<br/>2. K means clustering<br/>3. SVM's<br/>4. K Nearest Neighbours<br/>5. Any technique using regularisation |  |  
| What is gradient descent? | Gradient Descent is an optimization algorithm for finding a local minimum of a differentiable function. Gradient descent is simply used to find the values of a function's parameters (coefficients) that minimize a cost function as far as possible. |https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent |

## Preprocessing

| What is polynomial contrast? | The process of transforming ordered categorical variables / predictors to numeric quantities. | https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/105115/polynomial-contrasts-for-regression  |

## Feature selection

<br>

| Question | Answer | Reference |  
| :------- | :----- | :-------- |  
| What type of models feature automatic feature selection? | 1. Tree-based models<br/>2. MARS<br/>3. Elastic net / LASSO<br/>4. Nearest shrunken centroids<br/>5. GAM's (use parameter "select = TRUE", effectively the same as LASSO) | https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/mgcv/html/gam.selection.html |
