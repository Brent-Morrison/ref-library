This website is a collection of Python and R notebooks that forms a reference for variance data analysis, modelling and machine learning tasks.  

Topics are arranged via the menu at the top of the page.  There will typically be a number of implementations of each topic across languages / frameworks.

The site is an addendum to my [blog](https://brentmorrison.netlify.app/).
